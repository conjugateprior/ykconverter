# YKConverter

This is version 0.5 of the helper application that tries to convert files to
text.

## Platform specifics

This code should build a jar but will need Jarbundler and Launch4j libraries
to make Windows and OSX applications.  Their paths are set in build.properties.

In theory there the obj-c code for launching help is redundant, provided
users are up to date with their OS.
