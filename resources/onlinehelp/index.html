<h2>YKConverter</h2>

<p>The YKConverter is an application for converting PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word, Excel, 
and Powerpoint 
documents into UTF-8 encoded plain text.  It will also convert text documents 
from your platform's native encoding into UTF-8 if you give it a hint.</p>

<h3>How do I convert a document?</h3>

<p>Simply some documents directly from your desktop onto
the main window to start the conversion process.  Alternatively you can select File&gt;Open
from the menu to find them using a file dialog.  Conversion
can take a few moments, depending on the size of the file and its format.
</p>

<p>After your documents are converted, their texts appear as tabs in
the application window.  You can edit each text in place if
necessary.
</p>

<h3>How do I save what I converted?</h3>

<p>When you're done converting documents you can save them, either one at a time 
or altogether.  Press the button marked with an old-style disk to save the document whose text
is currently showing in the window.  To save all your converted documents, 
select File&gt;Save All from the File menu.
</p>
<p> The converter saves the text from each converted file to a new
file, encoded as UTF-8 (a good Unicode encoding.)  The name of the
saved file is always the same as the original file, except that the
suffix of the original file e.g. <tt>.pdf</tt> is replaced by <tt>.txt</tt> to
indicate that it is text.</p>

<h3>Where are my converted files?</h3>

<p>Your converted texts are either all saved to a single folder of your choice 
or next to the original file.  This is determined by the application Preferences 
(File&gt;Preferences on Windows and Linux).</p>

<h3>How do I get rid of conversions I don't want?</h3>
<p>
To discard failed or unwanted text conversions press the
 button marked with a cross, or select File&gt;Discard from the File menu.
Discarding a conversion never affects the original file.
</p>

<h3>I only want a small section of my file</h3>

<p>
If you need a contiguous section from a converted file, e.g. the central
sections of a web page but not surrounding advertisements, then select the
part you want and press the final button on the tool bar marked with a text
selection icon.  This button performs the <i>opposite</i> of the usual 'Cut' function:
It removes all text except your selection.  
</p>

<h3>Conversion failed!</h3>

<p>Sometimes the conversion process fails.  This may happen if a PDF document is encrypted,
if the libraries used by the application cannot cope with a particular version of your 
file format, or simply because of a bug.</p>

<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Most of the actual conversion work is performed by third-party libraries:  
Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and PDF files are converted using code from
 the excellent Apache <a href="http://poi.apache.org">POI</a> and
  <a href="http://pdf.apache.org">PDFBox</a> projects.
HTML files are converted using the <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">TagSoup</a>
library.  
I cannot solve technical problems with these, although I may be able to suggest alternatives.
</p>

<h3>Conversion isn't very good</h3>
<p>Sometimes the converters don't do a good job.  In general, formatting will
always be lost.  The application does its best to correct 
frequently word-level errors, e.g. trying to rejoin words hyphenated over line breaks in PDF
 files, but there is a limit to the amount of post-processing that is possible to automate.</p>

<h4>PDF-specific problems</h4>
<p>
Some PDF files are in fact only pictures of documents, eg. documents created by scanning.  
If you are lucky
 the scanner used optical character recognition (OCR) to figure out what the text was and 
 embedded it in the PDF file.  
 </p>
<p>If embedded OCR text is available then the YKConverter should 
find it.  However, sometimes errors in the OCR process lead to partial or incorrect embedded text.  
This will make it appear as if the conversion process has partially failed.  
 A good way to determine whether it is the 
 original OCR or the conversion process that is at fault is to use Acrobat Reader's 'save as text'
 function.  If this shows the same errors, it is an OCR problem.
 </p>
 <p>
 Some PDF files are password protected.  These cannot be converted at the moment, even if you
 know the password.
